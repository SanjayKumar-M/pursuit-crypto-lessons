# Lesson 2: Introduction to Decentralized Applications (DApps)

Welcome to the second lesson of our blockchain curriculum! In this lesson, we will introduce the concept of decentralized applications (DApps) and discuss their system architecture. We will also explore the advantages of DApps over traditional Web 2.0 applications.

## What are DApps?

Decentralized applications (DApps) are applications that run on a distributed computing system, such as a blockchain network, rather than on a centralized server. They leverage the decentralized nature of blockchain technology to provide users with more control, transparency, and security compared to traditional Web 2.0 applications.

## System Architecture of DApps

A typical DApp consists of three main components:

1. **Smart Contracts**: The backend logic of the DApp is implemented as smart contracts running on a blockchain network. These contracts define the rules and data structures of the DApp and are responsible for processing transactions and maintaining the application's state.

2. **Peer-to-Peer Network**: DApps rely on a peer-to-peer (P2P) network to communicate with the underlying blockchain. This network is responsible for broadcasting transactions, propagating new blocks, and ensuring that all nodes in the network have a consistent view of the blockchain's state.

3. **Frontend Interface**: Like traditional applications, DApps have a frontend user interface (UI) that allows users to interact with the application. This interface is typically built using standard web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The frontend communicates with the smart contracts through a Web3 library, such as Web3.js or Ethers.js.

## Advantages of DApps over Traditional Web 2.0 Applications

DApps offer several advantages over traditional Web 2.0 applications, including:

1. **Decentralization**: DApps eliminate the need for a central authority, resulting in increased user control, reduced censorship, and enhanced resistance to failures and attacks.
2. **Transparency**: The open and transparent nature of blockchain technology ensures that all transactions and data are visible and verifiable by any participant in the network.
3. **Security**: By leveraging cryptographic techniques and consensus mechanisms, DApps provide a higher level of security and trust compared to centralized applications.
4. **Immutability**: Once data is written to a blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted. This feature ensures the integrity of the application's data and prevents unauthorized tampering.
5. **Tokenization**: DApps often incorporate native tokens that can be used to incentivize user participation, facilitate transactions, and align the interests of stakeholders within the ecosystem.
