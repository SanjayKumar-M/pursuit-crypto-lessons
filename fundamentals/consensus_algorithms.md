# Lesson: Consensus Algorithms in Blockchain Technology

Welcome to our lesson on consensus algorithms in blockchain technology. In this lesson, we'll explore the different consensus algorithms used in blockchain technology and how they ensure the integrity and security of the blockchain.

## What are Consensus Algorithms?

Consensus algorithms are a critical component of the blockchain system that ensures that all nodes in the network agree on the current state of the blockchain. The consensus algorithm is used to reach an agreement on the validity of a transaction and the current state of the blockchain. 

The consensus algorithm ensures that:

- Transactions are verified and added to the blockchain in a secure and immutable way
- Double-spending or other malicious activities are prevented
- All nodes in the network have the same copy of the blockchain

### Byzantine Fault Tolerance  
A core concept within Bitcoin, consensus systems, and distributed ledgers is Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT). As it relates to blockchain, it revolves around how actors within the network do not have complete information on the status of other actors and therefore must set thresholds for how agreements are reached. 
  
The goal of such components is to defend against faulty or malicious actors and assumes that *at least* a simple majority of actors are honest and operating correctly. Various consensus methods have different thresholds of what majority is needed. 

## Types of Consensus Algorithms

There are several types of consensus algorithms used in blockchain technology. Let's take a look at some of the most popular ones:

### Proof of Work (PoW)

Proof of Work is the most well-known and widely used consensus algorithm in blockchain technology. It is used in the Bitcoin blockchain and several other cryptocurrencies. In PoW, miners compete to solve a complex mathematical puzzle, and the first one to solve it gets to add a new block to the blockchain. The process is energy-intensive and requires a lot of computational power.

Here's a visual representation of how Proof of Work works:

               +-----------------------------------+
               |          Proposed Block           |
               |                                   |
               |  Nonce   |  Transaction Data  |  Hash  |
               |                                   |
               +-----------------------------------+
                                |
                                |
                 +-----------------------------+
                 |  Proof of Work Calculation  |
                 +-----------------------------+
                                |
                                |
            +-------------------------------------------+
            |  First Miner to Solve Puzzle Proposes Block |
            +-------------------------------------------+
            
            
       
### Proof of Stake (PoS)

Proof of Stake is a newer consensus algorithm that aims to solve some of the problems associated with PoW, such as energy consumption and scalability. In PoS, validators (similar to miners in PoW) are chosen based on the number of coins they hold or "stake" in the network. Validators are then responsible for adding new blocks to the blockchain, and they are incentivized to act honestly by receiving rewards for doing so.

Here's a visual representation of how Proof of Stake works:

              +-----------------------------------+
              |          Proposed Block           |
              |                                   |
              |  Nonce   |  Transaction Data  |  Hash  |
              |                                   |
              +-----------------------------------+
                              |
                              |
                      +--------------+
                      |  Validator 1 |
                      +--------------+
                              |
                              |
                      +--------------+
                      |  Validator 2 |
                      +--------------+
                              |
                              |
            +-------------------------------------------+
            |  Majority of Validators Agree on Block     |
            +-------------------------------------------+

## Less Common Consensus Algorithms  
  
While PoW and PoS have been the most commonly used consensus algorithms over the lifespan of the blockchain space, they are far from the only examples. Below are some of the others that have varying levels of usage.  
  
### Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)  
  
In a DPoS system, network validators are elected by users of the network with there being a limit on the total number allowed. Consensus is reached between the delegate set to produce blocks and help secure the network, with delegates that correctly validate blocks receiving the sum of transaction fees for that block. 

### Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET)  
  
PoET-based blockchain systems assign all nodes in the network an equal chance of block production, with time the node must wait to produce a block determined in a randomized lottery. Once a node’s given time is reached, it can “awake” and submit a new block to the chain for validation.  
  
### Proof of Burn (PoB)  
  
With each block, validators in a PoB network have the option of burning a portion of their block reward (i.e. verifiably sending tokens to an irrecoverable location). Ability to produce further blocks is given in proportion to prior number of tokens burned in past blocks.  
  
### Proof of Authority (PoA)  
  
Somewhat similar to DPoS, PoA networks utilize a set of approved validators to reach consensus. Without network users electing them, validators instead must earn their right to take the position in the network through a vetting process. The goal is to ensure that only trustworthy validators are able to commit blocks to the chain.
