# Lesson: Understanding DeFi with Etherscan

In this lesson, you will learn how to use Etherscan to explore decentralized finance (DeFi) projects on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand how to navigate Etherscan to explore DeFi protocols
- Identify key information and metrics for DeFi protocols
- Recognize common smart contract patterns and functions used in DeFi protocols

## Steps

1. Go to [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/).
2. In the search bar, type in the name of a DeFi protocol you want to explore, such as [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/).
3. Once you are on the protocol's Etherscan page, you can explore various information and metrics about the protocol, such as the total value locked (TVL), number of transactions, and number of holders.
4. You can also explore the smart contract code for the protocol by clicking on the "Contract" tab and then clicking on "View Contract Source Code". While the Solidity coding language used in smart contracts may be difficult to understand at first, you can still get a sense of the key functions and patterns used in the code.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for other DeFi protocols you are interested in, such as [AAVE](https://aave.com/) and [Compound](https://compound.finance/).
