# Lab: Creating a MetaMask Wallet

## Overview

In this lab, you will learn how to create a MetaMask wallet, which will allow you to interact with decentralized applications on the Ethereum network.

## Prerequisites

- A computer with Google Chrome installed

## Instructions

### 1. Install MetaMask

First, you'll need to install the MetaMask extension in Google Chrome.

1. Open Google Chrome and navigate to the [MetaMask website](https://metamask.io/).
2. Click the "Download" button.
3. Click "Add to Chrome" to install the extension.
4. Click "Add extension" to confirm the installation.
5. Click the MetaMask icon in the top-right corner of your browser window to open the extension.

### 2. Create a New Wallet

Now that you've installed MetaMask, you can create a new wallet.

1. Click the "Get Started" button.
2. Read and accept the terms of use.
3. Choose a strong password and click "Create."
4. Save your seed phrase somewhere safe. This will be the only way to recover your wallet if you forget your password.
5. Click "Next" to confirm that you've saved your seed phrase.
6. Confirm your seed phrase by selecting the words in the correct order.
7. Click "Confirm" to complete the wallet creation process.

### 3. Connect to a Network

Once you've created your wallet, you'll need to connect to a network in order to use it.

1. Click the network dropdown in the top-left corner of the MetaMask extension.
2. Select "Rinkeby Test Network" from the list of available networks.
3. Wait for the extension to connect to the network.

### 4. Get Some Test Ether

In order to use the Rinkeby test network, you'll need some test Ether.

1. Visit the [Rinkeby Faucet](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/).
2. Follow the instructions to receive test Ether.
3. Wait for the test Ether to be deposited into your MetaMask wallet.

### 5. Explore Decentralized Applications

Now that you have test Ether in your MetaMask wallet, you can explore decentralized applications on the Rinkeby test network.

1. Visit [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) to browse decentralized marketplaces.
2. Visit [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/) to trade ERC-20 tokens.
3. Visit [Aave](https://app.aave.com/) to earn interest on your cryptocurrency holdings.

## Conclusion

In this lab, you learned how to create a MetaMask wallet, connect to a network, get test Ether, and explore decentralized applications. With these skills, you're ready to start using Web3 and participating in the decentralized economy.
