# Lab 3: Exploring DApps with Interoperability

In this lab, you will explore DApps that showcase interoperability between different blockchain networks. This hands-on experience will help you understand the importance of interoperability and see how it can enhance the functionality and usability of DApps.

## Instructions

1. **Select DApps to explore**: Choose at least two different DApps that demonstrate interoperability between blockchains. You can find examples of such DApps in the following list:

   - [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/): A decentralized exchange that supports the trading of Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), a tokenized representation of Bitcoin on the Ethereum network.
   - [Curve Finance](https://curve.fi/): A decentralized exchange that allows users to trade between different stablecoins, including those from different blockchain networks, using cross-chain bridges and wrapped tokens.
   - [Thorchain](https://app.thorswap.finance/): A decentralized exchange that enables the swapping of native assets between various blockchain networks.

2. **Visit the DApp website**: Go to the website of each DApp you've selected. Some DApps may require you to switch to a specific network or connect your MetaMask wallet. Follow the necessary steps to interact with the DApp.

3. **Explore the DApp's interoperability features**: Spend some time exploring the interoperability features of each DApp. Try out different actions, such as swapping assets between different blockchains or participating in cross-chain liquidity pools. Observe how the DApp leverages interoperability to enhance its functionality and user experience.

4. **Disconnect your wallet**: Once you've finished exploring a DApp, disconnect your wallet from the DApp, if applicable. This can usually be done through the DApp's user interface or by disconnecting the site from your MetaMask extension.

5. **Repeat the process**: Repeat steps 1-4 for each DApp you've chosen to explore.
