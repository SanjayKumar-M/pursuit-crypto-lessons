## What are NFTs?

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are digital assets that represent ownership of unique items like artwork, music, videos, and more. Unlike fungible tokens like Bitcoin or Ethereum, each NFT is unique and cannot be replicated.

## How do NFTs work?

NFTs are created on a blockchain, usually on the Ethereum network, using smart contracts. The smart contract contains the rules for creating and selling the NFT, as well as the metadata associated with the NFT (e.g. the artwork or music file). When an NFT is created, it is assigned a unique identifier called a token ID.

NFTs can be bought and sold on NFT marketplaces, where buyers can bid on or purchase the NFT using cryptocurrency. When an NFT is sold, the ownership of the NFT is transferred to the new owner, who can then display or use the NFT as they wish.

## Popular NFT platforms

There are several popular NFT platforms, including:

- OpenSea: a peer-to-peer marketplace for buying and selling NFTs
- Rarible: a platform for creating and selling NFTs, with a focus on art and collectibles
- SuperRare: a curated platform for high-end digital art
- NBA Top Shot: an officially licensed platform for buying and selling NBA-related NFTs

## Use cases for NFTs

NFTs have a wide range of potential use cases, including:

- Digital art and collectibles
- Music and other forms of media
- Gaming items and virtual real estate
- Identity and reputation systems
- Decentralized finance (DeFi) applications

The possibilities are endless, and we are only scratching the surface of what NFTs can do.
