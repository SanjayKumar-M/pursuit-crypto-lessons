# Pursuit Crypto: Blockchain and Web3 Case Studies

Welcome to the Case Studies section of the Pursuit Crypto curriculum! In this section, we'll be deep diving into some of the most exciting and innovative applications of blockchain and Web3 technology, including NFTs, DeFi, Layer 2s, Layer 1 blockchains, and identity.

## Course Outline

### 1. NFTs
In this module, we'll be exploring the world of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which are unique digital assets that are stored on a blockchain. We'll examine the technology behind NFTs, their use cases in art, gaming, and other industries, and how they are changing the way we think about ownership and value in the digital age.

### 2. [DeFi](https://github.com/joinpursuit/pursuit-crypto-lessons/tree/main/case_studies/defi)
In this module, we'll be diving into the world of decentralized finance (DeFi), which is a new financial system built on blockchain technology. We'll explore how DeFi protocols and tools like AAVE, Compound, and Uniswap are being used to lend, borrow, trade, and invest without intermediaries, and how DeFi is disrupting traditional finance.

### 3. Layer 2s
In this module, we'll be exploring Layer 2 solutions, which are protocols built on top of Layer 1 blockchains to improve scalability, reduce costs, and increase transaction speed. We'll examine the technology behind Layer 2 solutions like Optimism, Arbitrum, and Polygon, and how they are being used to improve the user experience of decentralized applications (dApps).

### 4. Layer 1 Blockchains
In this module, we'll be examining some of the most popular Layer 1 blockchains, including Ethereum, Polkadot, and Solana. We'll explore the unique features and benefits of each blockchain, and how they are being used for a variety of use cases, from DeFi to gaming to supply chain management.

### 5. Identity
In this module, we'll be exploring the intersection of blockchain and identity, and how blockchain technology is being used to create decentralized identity systems. We'll examine the technology behind decentralized identity solutions like uPort, Sovrin, and Civic, and how they are being used to provide individuals with more control over their personal data and privacy.

We hope you enjoy this section of the curriculum and gain a deeper understanding of the exciting and innovative applications of blockchain and Web3 technology.
