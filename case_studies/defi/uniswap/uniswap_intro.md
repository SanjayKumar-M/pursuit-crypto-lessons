## Uniswap: A Brief Overview

### Background and History of Uniswap

Uniswap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Ethereum blockchain. It was created by Hayden Adams in November 2018, inspired by a post from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. Uniswap is one of the most popular DEXes in the DeFi ecosystem and has played a significant role in the growth of decentralized finance.

### Uniswap's Core Mission and Objectives

Uniswap aims to provide a decentralized, trustless, and censorship-resistant trading platform for various tokens in the Ethereum ecosystem. It allows users to swap tokens, provide liquidity, and participate in governance without the need for a centralized authority or intermediary. Uniswap's objectives include:

- Democratizing access to financial services
- Encouraging financial innovation
- Facilitating the growth of the Ethereum ecosystem

### Uniswap's Token: UNI and Its Role in the Ecosystem

UNI is the governance token of the Uniswap protocol. It allows token holders to participate in the governance process, proposing and voting on changes to the protocol. UNI can also be staked to earn rewards and is used as an incentive mechanism to align the interests of the community and the protocol.
