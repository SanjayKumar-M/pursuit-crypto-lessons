## Use Cases of Aave

Aave provides various use cases for users within the DeFi ecosystem, enabling them to lend, borrow, and manage their assets in a decentralized manner. Some of the most prominent use cases include:

1. **Lending and Earning Interest**: Users can deposit supported assets into Aave's LendingPool to earn interest. Interest rates are determined by the platform's interest rate models, which dynamically adjust based on supply and demand factors.

2. **Borrowing Assets**: Users can borrow assets against their deposited collateral, choosing between variable and stable interest rate loans. Borrowers need to maintain a sufficient collateral-to-debt ratio to avoid liquidation, which occurs if the value of their collateral falls below a certain threshold.

3. **Flash Loans**: Aave's flash loans enable users to borrow assets without collateral, provided they repay the loan within the same Ethereum transaction. This innovative feature enables various use cases, such as arbitrage, collateral swaps, and self-liquidation.

4. **Credit Delegation**: Aave's credit delegation feature allows depositors to delegate their credit lines to other users or smart contracts, enabling them to borrow assets without providing collateral. This feature can facilitate undercollateralized loans and expand the borrowing capabilities of the DeFi ecosystem.

5. **Liquidation and Health Factor**: Aave uses a health factor system to determine the risk of a borrower's position. If a borrower's health factor falls below the required threshold, their position can be liquidated, allowing liquidators to repay a portion of the borrower's debt in exchange for the borrower's collateral at a discounted rate.

6. **Tokenized Debt Positions**: Aave v2 introduced tokenized debt positions, enabling users to transfer, trade, or use their debt positions in other DeFi protocols, further enhancing the platform's composability and flexibility.

7. **Governance and Staking**: AAVE token holders can participate in the platform's governance by proposing and voting on changes to the protocol. Users can also stake their AAVE tokens in the Safety Module to earn rewards and secure the protocol.
