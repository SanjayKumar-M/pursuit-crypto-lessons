## Use Cases of Compound

Compound offers various use cases within the DeFi ecosystem, enabling users to lend, borrow, and manage their assets in a decentralized manner. Some of the most prominent use cases include:

1. **Lending and Earning Interest**: Users can deposit supported assets into Compound's money markets to earn interest. Interest rates are determined by the platform's interest rate models, which dynamically adjust based on supply and demand factors.

2. **Borrowing Assets**: Users can borrow assets against their deposited collateral. Borrowers need to maintain a sufficient collateral-to-debt ratio to avoid liquidation, which occurs if the value of their collateral falls below a certain threshold.

3. **Trading cTokens**: cTokens, which represent users' supplied assets and accrued interest, can be traded on decentralized exchanges (DEXes) and used in other DeFi protocols, enhancing composability and liquidity.

4. **Leveraged Trading**: Users can take advantage of leveraged trading opportunities by borrowing assets on Compound, using them to make trades, and then repaying the loan with potential profits.

5. **Liquidation**: Users can participate as liquidators on the Compound platform by monitoring borrowers' collateral-to-debt ratios and liquidating undercollateralized positions, earning a liquidation incentive in the process.

6. **Governance and Earning COMP**: COMP token holders can participate in Compound's governance by proposing and voting on changes to the protocol. Users can also earn COMP tokens by interacting with the platform, as the tokens are distributed to both lenders and borrowers.
