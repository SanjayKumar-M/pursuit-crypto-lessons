# Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Explainer

Decentralized finance, or DeFi, is a new financial system that is built on decentralized technologies like blockchain. DeFi aims to provide an open, transparent, and accessible alternative to traditional financial systems, allowing anyone to participate in financial activities like lending, borrowing, trading, and investing, without the need for intermediaries like banks or brokers.

## Popular DeFi Protocols

In this course, we'll be diving into some of the most popular DeFi protocols and tools:

### AAVE
AAVE is a decentralized lending platform that allows users to borrow and lend cryptocurrency without the need for intermediaries. Users can earn interest on their crypto holdings by depositing them into lending pools, or they can borrow funds at lower rates than traditional lenders.

### Compound
Compound is another lending and borrowing platform that allows users to earn interest on their cryptocurrency holdings and borrow funds at competitive rates. Compound uses a unique algorithm to determine interest rates and incentivizes users to supply liquidity to the platform.

### Uniswap
Uniswap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that allows users to trade Ethereum-based tokens without the need for intermediaries. Uniswap uses an automated market maker (AMM) model to determine prices, which means that users can trade tokens without needing to match buyers with sellers.

### Olympus DAO
Olympus DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that operates a treasury of reserve assets, including the OHM token, which is designed to maintain its purchasing power over time. OHM holders can participate in the DAO's governance and earn rewards for providing liquidity to the protocol.

### Terra Luna
Terra Luna is a blockchain platform that allows for the creation of stablecoins that are pegged to various fiat currencies. These stablecoins can be used for payments, trading, and other financial activities, and can provide a more stable store of value than volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

We'll explore how each of these protocols work, their unique features and benefits, and real-world examples of how they are being used in the DeFi ecosystem. By the end of this section, you'll have a solid understanding of how these protocols fit into the broader DeFi landscape and how you can use them to your advantage. So let's dive in and explore the exciting world of DeFi!
