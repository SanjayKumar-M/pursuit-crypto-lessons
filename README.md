# Pursuit Crypto - Post Core Learning

The curriculum is separated into several modules:

| Module | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Fundamentals](https://github.com/joinpursuit/pursuit-crypto-lessons/tree/main/fundamentals) | In this module, fellows will learn about the layers of Web 3, consensus algorithms (Proof of Work/Proof of Stake), the history of crypto(so far), and learn the fundamentals of being a Blockchain Developer |
| [Case Study Series](https://github.com/joinpursuit/pursuit-crypto-lessons/tree/main/case_studies) | This module will dive into real world use cases of Blockchain Technology and Cryptocurrency, and fellows will get the chance to build on top of, or interact with these applications themselves |
| [Dapp Development](https://github.com/joinpursuit/pursuit-crypto-lessons/tree/main/dapps) | In this module, fellows will learn about languages and frameworks such as Solidity (smart contract language), Web3.js, Ethers.js, Truffle, Ganache, Hardhat, React/Javascript, and JSON RPC. They will also work on various projects, including an NFT Collection Project, IPFS, PINATA, ERC-721, a DApp Project with ERC-20 contract, and an interoperability project. |

## Technical / Computer Science

### Layers of Web 3
- Layer 0: Peer-to-peer (p2p) internet overlay protocols 
- Layer 1: Zero/low trust interaction protocols (Bitcoin/Ethereum) 
- Layer 2: Oracles, Computation, etc. 
- Layer 3: Developer APIs and Languages 
- Layer 4: Applications 
- Layers 0 - 2 only need to be understood at a high level. The real meat and potatoes is around intimate understanding of Layer 3-4.

### Consensus Algorithms
- Proof of Work/Proof of Stake

### Economics & A little bit of Crypto History / Understanding the Space
- Understanding the history and current economic systems
- The incentive for Satoshi to create Bitcoin
- Why "trustless" transactions are potentially better than our current financial system
- How money is used as an "instrument of change"
- Three generations of Cryptocurrencies

### Case Study Series
- Olympus DAO 
- Helium 
- Uniswap 
- Polkadot 
- ENS 
- Chainlink
- Polygon
- Decentraland 
- Solona

### Software Development
- Languages & Frameworks: Solidity (Smart Contract Language), Web3.js, Ethers.js (JavaScript packages that communicate with DApp frontends), Truffle, Ganache, Hardhat (Local Development environments that allow you to run a local blockchain), React/Javascript 
- Understanding JSON RPC
- Projects: NFT Collection Project, IPFS, PINATA, ERC-721, DApp Project with ERC-20 contract (Making their own De-Fi protocol), Interoperability project (Wrapping Tokens, Crosschain transfers)  

## Economics & Crypto History

### Understanding the Space
- Understanding the history and current economic systems
- The incentive for Satoshi to create Bitcoin
- Why "trustless" transactions are potentially better than our current financial system
- How money is used as an "instrument of change"
- Three generations of Cryptocurrencies

### Important Events to Study
- The DAO Hack
- Bitcoin's Inflation Hack
- Polygon's Hack
- The "split" between the founders of Ethereum
- The creation of Bitcoin Cash

### Case Study Series
- Olympus DAO 
- Helium 
- Uniswap
